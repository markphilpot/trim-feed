If you run into an RSS feed that doesn't seem to work with RSS Readers and your browser might give an error like

![](@/images/example-error.jpg)

you might be able to `trim` the feed to make it work.

Add `https://trim.markphilpot.com/.netlify/functions/trim?feed=${feedUrl}` and see if that helps!
